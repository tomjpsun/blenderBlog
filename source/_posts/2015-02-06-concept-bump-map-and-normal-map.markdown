This is an abstract from [Kent Trammell](http://cgcookie.com/blender/profile/theluthier)

Typically “Bump Maps” are grayscale-value images that are used to manipulate an object’s “normals” which control the way light interacts with an object’s surface shading.

“Normal Maps” are slightly more advanced bump maps that us RGB values (which appear purpleish) to influence an object’s normals with higher fidelity.

Both are non-physically-accurate CG *tricks* that do not affect an object’s profile, only surface shading.
