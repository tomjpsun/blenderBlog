Under `Texture painting mode` and display shading with `Multitexture`, if we want to picking color for texture paint ...

The old hot-key is `shift` + `right mouse click`

Now it has been changed to `s` + `mouse over` on the view, we could change the color for painting.

In Texture painting mode, and shade with Multitexture, hold `s` + `mouse over` the y axis, we can get green for painting.
