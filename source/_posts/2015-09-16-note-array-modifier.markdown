The array modifer is a powerful modifier in Blender.

While using it for making objects, say, chain. The first thing that is confusing is the magnify of each array elements, like this:

This can be corrected by applying the object's 'scale'

Then we get the correct chain:

I was fooling around here for several times, don't forget it next time.
