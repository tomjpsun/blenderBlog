Just as memo here.

Jason Welsh has made a series of Blender videos, which is very helpful. One of the course is ["Texture, Mapping and Materials in Blender"](https://itunes.apple.com/tw/itunes-u/texture-mapping-materials/id505540960?l=zh&mt=10)

The course material is shown in somewhere in his video. I have paid time to search it, and memo here:
