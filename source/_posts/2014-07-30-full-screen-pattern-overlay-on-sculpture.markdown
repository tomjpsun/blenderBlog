When we use pattern image for sculpturing. A 'HUD' there is very handy. A picture can tell:

Hear is how: ( 3 Red rectangles )

* 1 The 'HUD' overlay is only meaningful by some sculpturing tools, like `mask`,`brush`.
* 2 `Mapping Mode` is `tile`.
* 3 The `eye icon` in `overlay` should be toggled on.

Then, you will see the pattern overlaied on screens, you can __predict the result before you really sculpturing__ on the object.

## 

The accompanied keys are:

`F`: Change brush size.

`Ctrl`+`F`: Rotate pattern.

Both the keys will influence on the overlay immediately.

Blender is awesome !!
